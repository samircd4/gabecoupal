Hi Samir, I want a bot that scrapes this website for the company name, the next ex-date, and the dividend yield then puts it all into a csv file in an organized format using python and beutifulsoup. If possible could you also add it so that it clicks on the arrow toward the right side of the screen to move to the next day and repeat the process? website URL = https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/dividends/canada
